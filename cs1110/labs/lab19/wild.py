class WildCard(card.Card):
    """
    A class to represent a deck of cards with jokers.

    Most decks have two jokers: a red joker and a black joker.  We will not
    make a difference between these two jokers, since color does not matter
    during play.

    Jokers are wild cards, meaning that they can be turned into whatever card
    you want to turn them into.  This means that a Joker card can have a normal
    suit and rank (representing what we want to convert the joker to).  So we
    identify jokers with a new attribute wild (which has getters and setters).

    This class does not need to make any changes to the setters and getters
    for suit and rank, as those attributes are unchanged.  However, the
    introduction of Jokers does change the meaning of the setter/getter for
    the codes. Jokers are represented by the two-character code 'WC'. Setting
    a card with that code creates a Joker equivalent to the Ace of Spades.

        for 3 of hearts, and 'KS' stands for king of spades).  We use 'T'

        Initializes a card with given the suit and rank.

        The suits and rank are represented as integers. Alternatively,
        suit and rank can be encoded together in a two-character string like
        '3H' (3 of hearts) or 'KS' (king of spades).  We use 'T' for Ten.
        The code 'WC' indicates a joker.  By default, jokers are equivalent
        to the Ace of Spades.

        The possible suits are given in SUIT_NAMES, while the possible ranks
        are given in RANK_NAMES.  There is no rank 0.

        Example: if we execute c = Card(0, 12), then this card is the Queen of
        Clubs, since SUIT_NAMES[0] is 'Clubs' and RANK_NAMES[12] is 'Queen'.
        The same card could be created by Card(code='QC').
