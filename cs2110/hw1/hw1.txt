1. Write the algorithm for executing the Java assignment statement <variable>= <expression>;
	
	Evaluate the <expression> and store its value in the <variable>.
	
2. Write the algorithm for executing the Java if-statement: 
	if (<boolean-expression>) <statement 1>

	Evaluate the <boolean-expression>, and if it is true, execute <statement 1>.
	
3. Write the algorithm for executing the Java if-else-statement:
	if (<boolean-expression>) <statement 1> else <statement 2>

	Evaluate the <boolean-expression>, and if it is true, execute <statement 1>. If it is not true, execute <statement 2>.
	
4. Tell us in a few words what you thought of the videos on presenting algorithms in English and executing 
the assignment statement, their message, and the homework.

	I thought the videos were very helpful, following up on HW0 well. I was constructive to see common mistakes in 
	the last HW, and that we are to use the solution in the follow-up questions in HW1, getting progressively harder.
